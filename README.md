# NBA_Player_Prediction
The NBA's Next Generation
Using data and machine learning classification modeling to predict the next generation of NBA starts. Can the data tell us something that our eyes can't?

In fulfillment of the second part of my capstone project I wrote an article outlining the entire process of data gathering, manipulation, exploration, preprocessing, modeling and analysis. This is exploration #1 for my NBA Player Modeling Capstone project and I hope to have many more.
