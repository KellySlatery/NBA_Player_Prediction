    "This project is an attempt to glean information about NBA Players. When teams invest in a player they are taking a risk. They pay them millions of dollars for the promise of a return on the basketball court and or through marketing/ticket sales. These two are obviously related but that relationship is not one to one. Here I wanted to focus on whether you could predict the future performance of an NBA player based on his statistics in his first two years:\n",

    "This data was downloaded from Basketball Reference's (https://www.basketball-reference.com/) advanced metrics tables for each NBA season going back to 2006. I also took data from the NBA draft tables going back to 2006. I am using all of this information to create a single dataframe that I will use to model the data. The reason I chose to go back to 2006 is that this was the first year that the NBA required draft picks to be one year removed from high school. I decided not to go back any farther because I suspected that there could be significant differences between the draft classes that included high schoolers and those that haven't in the past 15 years.\n",
